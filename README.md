Researching about Unity's addressable asset, to find proper way to use it :P

- [1](https://github.com/insthync/unity-addressable-asset-research/commit/e8837d93461f2f342183e99e3070c2bcaebf4672) Try load asset from addressable to use as prefab, and release it after all destroyed, it works as intended.
