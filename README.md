# unity-addressable-asset-research
Researching about Unity's addressable asset, to find proper way to use it :P

- [1](https://github.com/insthync/unity-addressable-asset-research/commit/e8837d93461f2f342183e99e3070c2bcaebf4672) Try load asset from addressable to use as prefab, and release it after all destroyed, it works as intended.
- [2](https://github.com/insthync/unity-addressable-asset-research/commit/09b3a3206ecb20aedf4e8c4b64779e1c009978b1) Try instantiate more than one instance, it works as intended, all memory were cleared.
